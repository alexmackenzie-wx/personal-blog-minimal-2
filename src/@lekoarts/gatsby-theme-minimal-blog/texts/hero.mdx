  Hello 👋🏻
</Text>

I'm Alex - a Partner at [Tapestry](https://tapestry.vc/) a seed stage venture firm that invests in repeat and/or technical founders across Europe & the US. We're fortunate to work with teams such as [Standard Cognition](https://standard.ai/), [Hopin](https://hopin.com/), [Crossbeam](https://www.crossbeam.com/), [Zapp](https://tryzapp.com/) & [Nothing](https://nothing.tech/).

My current areas of investment research include: computation platforms, cloud native security and general developer tooling/infra.

Beyond investing I'm interested in BJJ, fashion history, gaming, programming language design, etc.

Based in London & always up for a coffee/chat >> alex[at]tapestry.vc
